Node js : It executes js code outside the browser  , On serversite 
    Run time environment 

    JS lib-backend Dev
    Runtime env.-Used to run JS outside the browser i.e server side scripting
    Run on chrome v8 engine
    Programming languages: JavaScript, Python, C, C++, CoffeeScript

# How Applications works 

Layers of application :
    Front end layer / Client side 
    Backend Layer / Server side  : work API creation and Database communication , 
    Database Layer 

#Features-
    Is Async driven JS runtime env. (Non Blocking Operations) : we are writing only callback funtions here 
    cross platform
    Open source JS library
    Single Thereded : At a time eak kam karna 
    
# API Development
    API is one of the most important for backend Development
    i.e data flow send/recieve
    80% works-data travesing 
    Mostly we are create API using Node js , 

# Real time features
Node.js is commonly used to develop real-time applications, also known as RTAs. 
    Its asynchronous, event-driven mature, allows it to handle heavy input-output operations,
     which makes it much easier for Node.js developers to achieve 
     the level of performance users have come to expect from modern real-time applications

    SPA- data updating without reloading browser / page
    APPS- NASA, netflix, walmart, twitter

    Real time apps google meet-continue communication-live stream app-
        Web socket-
            continue data flow-req, res
            fast commu- continue connection

Difference bet API and Socket : ? 



Data streaming-smoothing
    netflix, amazon
    audio/video streaming
    data pipelining i.e transfer small small data
Mircoservices architecture-
    Every module has their own service
    Micro-service and server less application
    Like AMazon, whatsapp-insta-
    Divide our app into parts and place each ms in team and develope every section as per need 
        without affecting other section i.e lightweight easy integration with server less acrchitecture

Easy dovelopment : 

    i.e build flexible apps 

REST API- protocol having rules and regulation 
    to build API rest architecture
    chunk data

Key benefits of Node.js 

    # Single-threaded: With event looping, the server uses a non-blocking mechanism to respond.
    # Super-fast: Codes are executed quickly on the V8 JavaScript Engine
    #Event-driven: 'Events of Node.js' is a notification system that enables the application server to capture the response of the previous API call.
    #Buffer-less: There is no buffering as data is simply released in chunks.
    #Asynchronous: The non-blocking, non-synchronous Node.js libraries move to the next API and do not await the return data of the previous API.
    # Highly-scalable: Servers can handle as many requests as coming their way\
    #Licensed: The program is authorized under a software license.
    #Microsoft, PayPal, Uber, eBay, and Yammer are leading companies actively using Node.js application development for their projects.

Callback Function :

    passing one funciton to another function as a argument 
    i.e exetute one function into another function , 
    one fun execute after another fun finish their execution 
e.g.
    

functionn A(){
    console.log("Helllo A")
}

functionn B(Callback){
    Callback()
    console.log("Helllo B")
}

B(A)




     Node js by default execute Async 
     non- blocking operation
